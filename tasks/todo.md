## Risk Assessment & Learning Notes

[LOW RISK] Basic routing, static components, CSS styling
[MEDIUM RISK] Framer Motion integration, markdown processing
[HIGH RISK] Complex animations, dynamic content loading

**Key Learning Concepts:**
- File-based routing in Next.js 15
- Component composition patterns
- CSS-in-JS vs Tailwind approaches
- State management for animations
- Markdown-to-React conversion
- Mobile-first responsive design

## Next Steps
1. **Review this plan together** - discuss any adjustments needed
2. **Start with Phase 1** - basic routing and page structure
3. **Iterate and learn** - pause between phases to understand concepts
